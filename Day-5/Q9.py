# What is the output of the following Python code?
# x = 10
# y = 50
# if x ** 2 > 100 and y < 100:
#     print(x, y)

# Ans: empty, because we did not mentioned an equality operator and used and operator. the and operator will executes the program
# when both of the expression true, here first expression gets false and second one will get true so it obviously throws false 
# so this will not print the values, just throw an empty space
