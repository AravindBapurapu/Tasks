# What is the output of the expression print(-18 // 4)

# Ans: -5 => becasue as previously discussed, floor devision will round figures the value if the value is 4.5 in positive then it
# round figure as equal to the num or lower the number so in this question we get -4.5 value so -4 is greater than -4.5 so obviosly
# we get it as -5.
