# 4 is 100 in binary and 11 is 1011. What is the output of the following
# bitwise operators?
# a = 4
# b = 11
# print(a | b)
# print(a << 2)


# Ans: first print ans will be 15, because binary of 4 is 100 and binary no of 11 is 1011 so as per the binary calculation
# 0100 | 1011 => so 1111 => so this will give us a num 1
# second print as will be 16 - because left shift of 100 will be 0100 is one for first time but there is left shift two 
# so left shift two is 10000 => this refer the num two
# in other way =>  so here two decimals added then the value is equal to 16
