# What is the output of the following code?
x = 100
y = 50
print(y and x)

# Ans: 50  => here both variable has their own value other than 0, non zero elements throws the true values and 0 throws false
# so if the both values would true(means consist any value), then it will throw the second variable value (which you compare or write after and condition)
# if you swap the value then it would not change any value. but if you call ro comapare them swapping then the out put will be the last called value's.
