# Q1. Type here. Assign a number to the variable: glass_of_water
# glass_of_water= 8
# print("I drank", glass_of_water, "glasses of water today.")

# Q2. Fill the print function so it prints glass_of_water 
# glass_of_water=3
# glass_of_water=glass_of_water + 1
# print(glass_of_water)

# Q3. Assign an integer to the variable, then print it. 
# men_stepped_on_the_moon= int(500)
# print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)

# Q4. Type a couple of words or a short sentence for your variable, then print it. 
# my_reason_for_coding= "I am a human being"
# print(my_reason_for_coding)

# Q5. Assign a float with 2 decimals to the variable below. If you don't wan't to search the value you can check out Hint 1. 
# global_mean_sea_level_2018=21
# global_mean_sea_level_2018= 15.21
# print(global_mean_sea_level_2018)

# Q6. Assign True or False to the variable below then print it.
# staying_alive= True
# print(staying_alive)

# Q7. Type a couple of different values inside the print function. Make sure they are separated by commas. 
# print(12, "hello brother!", 1520.423, True, ["hello", "bro!"])

# Q8. You can assign "Hello World!" to the variable.
# my_text="Hello World!"
# print(my_text)

# Q9. Replace "type here" with "Hello World!"
# print("type here")
# print("Hello World!")

# Q10. .In Python, a variable must be declared before it is assigned a value:
# A. True
# B. False
# ans: false - because in python variable decalration and assigning value both can happen at one step

# Q11. Which of the following statements assigns the value 100 to the variable x in Python:
# A. x := 100
# B. let x = 100
# C. x << 100
# D. x = 100
# E. x ← 100

# ans: option- D

# Q12. Which of the following are valid Python variable names:
# A. Age
# B. home_address
# C. ver1.3
# D. return
# E. 4square
# F. route66

# ans: option A, B, F - because C is used dot so its not takes as variable as well as option D is a predefined function
#  and optin E is started with a number - as per the variable/integer declaration rules in python.

# Q13. You are reading Python code, and these statements appear scattered in different locations throughout the code:
# employeenumber = 4398
# .
# .
# EmployeeNumber = 4398
# .
# .
# employeeNumber = 4398

# A. These statements refer to different variables.
# B. These statements refer to the same variable

# ans: option a is correct because python is case sensitive. here the name is same but both are different variables as python is case sensitive

# Q14. Which of the following would give a syntax error?
# A. x, y, z = 10, 20, 30
# B. x, y, z = 10, ‘Hello’, True
# C. x = 10, y =’Hello’, z = True
# D. None of the above

#ans: optin D is correct -  because in python we can declare multiple variables at once so three option are correct

# Q15. What is the value of the following arithmetic expression 5*2**10?
# ans: 5120, because 2 power 10 is 1024 then multiply with 5 finally we get 5120
