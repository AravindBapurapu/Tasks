'''# Q5 ==> # If you are dividing, you can use two forward slashes to do floor division:'''
# myTotal = 7 // 5
# This will get you the answer of 1 rather than the 1.4 we had before.

# Ans ==> : that is because of floor devision just round figures the num and give some exact value than the float value.
# with this we can get a num or object from the variables when their length is odd so here it is helpful.

'''Q6: You can tell Python what you mean with round brackets, parentheses. Add
two round brackets to your code:
myTotal = (8 + 2) * 10 '''

# myTotal = (8+2)*10   #here first 8+2=10 will happens then 10*10=100, so the ans is 100
# print("My total is:",myTotal)

'''Q7: For example, change your myTotal line to this:
myTotal = 8 + 2 * 10'''

# myTotal = 8 + 2 * 10 # here there is no brackets so it will multiply first then addition so => 2*10=20 => 20+8= 28=> ans is 28
# print("My total is:",myTotal)

'''Q8: Likewise, if we had this:
myTotal = 8 + 10 / 2 - total would be: 13.0 => to print only 13 then we must use // (floor devision)
But if we add round brackets:
myTotal = (8 + 10) / 2- here total would be: 9.0'''
# myTotal = (8 + 10) / 2
# print(myTotal)

'''Q9: So, Python sees that there is 16 stored in the numberOne variable and 4
stored in the numberTwo variable. It adds these up and stores the result in
the answer variable.
You can also mix the two, variables and hard-code numbers:
answer = numberOne + numberTwo + 20
answer = 10 * numberOne + (numberTwo + 20)
answer = numberOne + 20 + numberTwo - 10'''

# numberOne = 16
# numberTwo = 4

# answer1 = numberOne + numberTwo
# print("ans one",answer1)
# answer2 = numberOne + numberTwo + 20
# print(f"ans two: {answer2}")
# answer3 = 10 * numberOne + (numberTwo + 20)
# print(f"ans three: {answer3}")
# answer4 = numberOne + 20 + numberTwo - 10
# print(f"ans four: {answer4}")


'''Q10:  Creating a program of strings with concatenation:
FirstName = “Quality”
SeconName = “Thought”
Expected Output:
Full Name is: Quality Thought'''

# FirstName = "Quality"
# SeconName = "Thought"

# Full_name = FirstName + " " + SeconName
# print(Full_name)
