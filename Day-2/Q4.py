# Type these numbers after the equals sign for your myTotal variable:
# myTotal = 4 + 2 * 8 - 6
# Can you see why the answer you get when you run your code is 14?


myTotal = 4+2*8-6
print(f"My total is: {myTotal}")

# out is 14-  because python follows BODMAS rule which is tells about math rules to get right ans
# B- Brackets, O - order(power or roots), D - division, M - multiplication, A - addition, S - Subtraction
