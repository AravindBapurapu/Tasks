# What is the output of the expression
# print (-18 // 4)

# ans: here the ans is -5 because floor division take the lowest value means it rouds down the value, if quotient is 4.5 then
#  it takes 4 and if -4.5 then it takes -5 because -5 is lower than the -4.5 => here it takes round figure(exact value without points)

print (-18 // 4)
